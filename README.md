# Next.js Tricks

- [`src/pages` will be used if `pages` is absent in the root directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/src-directory#caveats)
- [Avoid to use `jest-environment-enzyme` since it will makes `jest` testing merely slow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-environment-enzyme)
- [Next.js with absolute imports](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/2913#issuecomment-327901766)
